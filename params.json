It can be used for flask with mongodb applications development.\r\n* Three docker images are created:\r\n  * A base [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/laztoum/base/) from Ubuntu 16.04, including [gosu](https://github.com/tianon/gosu \"gosu\") \r\n  * A mongodb [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/laztoum/mongo/), with a root user and a database owner\r\n  * A third [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/laztoum/flask-gunicorn-nginx/) with flask (project files inside a volume), gunicorn (with the `--reload` option for autoreload on file change)  and nginx. Flask mongoengine's [example](https://github.com/MongoEngine/flask-mongoengine/tree/master/examples) is included.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n### Images and containers setup\r\nDocker is required. You can either \r\n* run [setup.sh](https://github.com/lazToum/docker_flask_mongodb_gunicorn_nginx/blob/master/setup.sh) inside the project's root directory or \r\n* install docker-compose *version >= 1.6* and use the  [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/lazToum/docker_flask_mongodb_gunicorn_nginx/blob/master/docker-compose.yml). Just run `docker-compose up` (optionally include the *-d* option to detach it)\r\nYou can then change anything inside the flask project  [files](https://github.com/lazToum/docker_flask_mongodb_gunicorn_nginx/tree/master/flask-gunicorn-nginx/flask-app) and view the changes on http://localhost.\r\n\r\n### Start | stop the containers\r\neither with\r\n* `docker start | stop flask-mongo && docker start | stop flask-gunicorn-nginx` or\r\n* `docker-compose start|stop` inside the folder containing *docker-compose.yml*\r\nThe mongo container has to start before the flask/gunicorn/nginx container.\r\n",
